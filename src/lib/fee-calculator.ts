 *
 *   "CUMULATIVE"  — Task B4. Each gate is its own charge. Paying HS1 leaves
 *                   HS2, HS3 and Final still owed; paying Final settles the lot.
 *                   The breeder eventually pays the sum of the gates.
 *
 *   "SINGLE"      — the Task D table. One obligation with four chances to
 *                   settle it, priced to escalate. Paying at any gate finishes
 *                   it, and the breeder pays that gate's price only.
 *
 * Set to SINGLE, confirmed by the organiser on 2026-09-21: "Pays either of the
 * 4 gates, if 1 is missed the following will be set the next gate, and final
 * race is the final gate, if none of the previous one is paid then they must
 * pay for the final race." One obligation, four chances to meet it, the price
 * escalating for leaving it. This settles the contradiction in the spec — the
 * Task B4 "Cascade rule" wording read the other way. See
 * docs/payment-spec-questions.md Q1.
